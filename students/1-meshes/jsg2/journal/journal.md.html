2016-09-14: Prep Work
=====================================================
Arrived at lab at about 7:45 pm (having already read through lab and done some thinking). Some delay due to impact testing going on in lab. Made preliminary workflow table by hand. Got on computer at about 8:05 pm. Used svn to set up new folder for lab, and copied folders over from starter (although may use 0-cubes instead?). Created blank document for report.

Created Workflow table, added heading to report.
Left lab at 8:52 pm

2016-08-12: Formatting Notes
=====================================================

This development journal is for you to maintain a log of your project.
It is in [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) format. It is
readable as plain text but will have additional nice formatting when loaded
in a web browser.

Put the newest entry at the top of this file, like a blog. Begin the title of
each section with a date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).

Press F4 or F6 in your G3D program to automatically add screenshots and video to 
this development journal.

2016-09-15: Scheduled Lab Period
=====================================================
Set up svn for lab.
Completed report draft and white cube model file. (I don't think further drafts of the cube will be needed, although position could change.)
Created functions for cylinder and heightfield (although parameters for heightfield will probably change.)


2016-09-14: Prep Work
=====================================================
Arrived at lab at about 7:45 pm (having already read through lab and done some thinking). Some delay due to impact testing going on in lab. Made preliminary workflow table by hand. Got on computer at about 8:05 pm. Used svn to set up new folder for lab, and copied folders over from starter (although may use 0-cubes instead?). Created blank document for report.

Created Workflow table, added heading to report.
Left lab at 8:52 pm

2016-08-12: Formatting Notes
=====================================================

This development journal is for you to maintain a log of your project.
It is in [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) format. It is
readable as plain text but will have additional nice formatting when loaded
in a web browser.

Put the newest entry at the top of this file, like a blog. Begin the title of
each section with a date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).

Press F4 or F6 in your G3D program to automatically add screenshots and video to 
this development journal.
